# Setting-up-for-a-Mod2-IC

##getting started with setting yourself up for a successful IC
  - #####fork the repo and then git clone
  - #####check gems
      if using ShouldaMatchers make sure that the following is included at the *bottom* of `rails_helper.rb`
        
          Shoulda::Matchers.configure.do |config|
            config.integrate do |with|
              with.test_framework :rspec
              
              with.library :rails
            end
          end
      
      if using Simplecov make sure that the following is included at the *tp* of `rails_helper.rb`
      
          require 'simplecov'
            SimpleCov.start
  - #####run bundle (bundle install) and possibly bundle update
  - #####check read me here and follow for next steps
  - #####review existing schemes.rb
      you may want to import schema to db.diagram if a visual is needed
  ###Table and Model Time!
    - once you are clear on the tables that need to be made and the relationships they will have
      in the terminal run `rails generate model TableName attribute:datatype attribute:datatype othertable:references`
      *the many to many join table usually only needs references, it does not meed attributes*
      *parents do not need foreign keys*
